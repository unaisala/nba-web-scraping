# NBA dataset using web scraping
The objective of this project is to get to know the basics of web scraping using python web scraping libraries.

The final datasets are presented in four different ways.

First, we have the numerical dataset, where the class is the salary of each of the players.

Second, there is the categorical dataset, that separates the class between those with a salary above the mean and those earning less.

Both datasets are in .csv and .arff versions.
